#### __What is this__?
This lib is a header only single file lib designed for the Graft mod loader project and its custom hooking API.  
#### __What does it do__?
CCC allows you to at runtime get the registers data gets stored in when calling any function!

CCC has a very specific use case so I dont expect you to need to use this project. The usecase for CCC is for hooking libs that have no idea of the function they are calling.
